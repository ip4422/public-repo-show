# displaying Github user's public repositories

Simple website using ReactJS + Typescript, that would allow displaying Github user's public repositories.
The main page should have an input and allow a user to enter Github's username. The second page would display available repositories for the entered user, and the thrid page would display the list of files in the repo + README.md content of the selected respository.
